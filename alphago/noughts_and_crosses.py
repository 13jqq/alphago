"""Noughts and crosses game

This module provides functionality for representing a game of noughts
and crosses. The game state is represented by a tuple of shape (9,)
with -1 for 'O', 1 for 'X' and np.nan for empty square. The outcome of
the game is given by a named tuple showing each player's outcome, where
+1, -1 and 0 correspond to a win, loss or draw, respectively.

Functions
---------
is_terminal:
    Return a bool indicating whether or not the input state is
    terminal.
utility:
    Return the outcome of terminal state.

Attributes
----------
INITIAL_STATE:
    A tuple representing the initial state of the game.
